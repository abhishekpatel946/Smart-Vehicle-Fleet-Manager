<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Smart Vehicle Fleet Manager
we are planning to make a system to manage entire fleet of an organisation, the system can enable vehicle tracking via GPS, detect over speeding, fuel levels, accident detection, facilitate anti-theft of vehicle and fuel,history of travel [24x7] ,record this entire data and present the data on a dashboard for easy understanding.

It also reduces dependence and management of manual log books which are required to be maintained by the driver since it has many flaws which are exploited, which leads to massive loss of government resources.So Fuel Theft can be stopped too.

The system can also facilitate on-time vehicle maintenance.
It can  be installed on government/private bus,trucks,bikes,site-vehicles,etc
The details can be monitored from a control room or a simple desktop via a dashboard. So fetching information can be very easy and convenient.
Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
